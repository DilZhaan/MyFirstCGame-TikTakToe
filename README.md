# Tic Tac Toe Game Readme

## Overview

This project involves learning key concepts in C programming, specifically dynamic memory allocation and file handling. While dynamic memory allocation may initially seem complex in C, I found valuable resources on YouTube that aided my understanding.

## Learning Process

### Dynamic Memory Allocation

To grasp dynamic memory allocation, I dedicated time to watching YouTube tutorials. The visual aids provided in these videos significantly enhanced my comprehension of this intricate concept.

### CheckWinner Function Challenges

The CheckWinner function posed a notable challenge due to the dynamic size of the tic-tac-toe board. To overcome this, I created a solution within two hours. To tackle the complexities, I sketched a tic-tac-toe board on paper, enabling me to discern patterns in indexing for diagonals, rows, and columns.

## Achievements

Throughout this project, I acquired knowledge and skills in the following areas:

- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- File Handling
- Working with 2D Arrays
- Error Handling
- Header File Management

## Conclusion

This project not only expanded my understanding of C programming but also allowed me to apply my knowledge to solve real-world challenges. Feel free to explore the code and documentation for a deeper insight into the implementation.
